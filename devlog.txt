6/18 -  beginning of this devlog 
        yesterday I implemented first drafts of planned chat routes and endpoints, reworked a lot of the frontend, added URL context, 
        and afterwards found out that URLs are generally stored in environmental variables. Oops! would be an easy fix if it becomes important.

        today I plan on finishing up the chats routes, setting up the db calls for messages to display in chats, and tuning the frontend to display them correctly

        down the line- refactor context and hooks into two separate directories, import context into hooks.

        today I finished chat routes, set up db calls for messages to display in chats, tuned frontend. 
        
        Next up: tune message routes and frontend, think about what's next after that! So many things...
        could do content types, avatars, adding friends, a million other things!
